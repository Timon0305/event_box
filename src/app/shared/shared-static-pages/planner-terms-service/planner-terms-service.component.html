            <span>2. Nature of Business.</span> Event Box provides a web-based platform called the Event Box Platform,
            that enables Vendors (a business or individual that provides party-related goods and/or services) and
            Planners (businesses or individuals seeking to sell or purchase event-related goods and/or services) to
            communicate and enter into an agreement directly between the each other (“Order”). The Event Box Platform
            only enables a connection between the parties. It does not, however, control, manage, monitor, or impact the
            fulfillment of an Order, nor does Event Box have or claim to have control over the quality, timing,
            legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the work included in the Order. Event Box
            makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of a
            Vendor or its goods or services, except to the extent that Vendor has been vetted by the Planner and/or
            Event Box.

          <p>

            for a Planner to use the Event Box Platform, but reserves the right, in Event Box’s sole discretion, to
            charge a flat, monthly, subscription, per transaction, or other fee in the future, upon notice to a Planner,
            in order to access, view, engage with or otherwise interact with the Event Box Platform in order to provide
            service to you (“Membership Fee”). The Membership Fee might be different than the amount paid by another new
            or existing member, who purchased at the same or similar time as you, in the same market. You acknowledge
            that Event Box reserves the right, at any time, to modify its Membership Fees and billing methods, with
            notice to you. Membership Fees may be paid in advance or on a monthly basis, by credit or debit card,

            authorized method of payment will be charged the Membership Fee, until you cancel your plan, which you may
            do at any time, pursuant to the cancellation provisions below. In the event that the payment processing for
            the renewal of your plan fails for any reason, we will not attempt to process your renewal payment again,
            but notify you that your membership did not renew.

              directors, corporate partners, or participants, liable for any damage, suits, claims, and/or controversies

              inability to use the Event Box Platform or any of Event Box’s related services, to the fullest extent
              permitted by governing and applicable law. In some jurisdictions, limitations of liability are not
              permitted. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitations may not apply to You. Event Box does
              not accept any responsibility for the quality or fitness of any work performed or goods provided by a

                on the Event Box Platform represents a substantial portion of the value You receive from your
                Membership. Therefore, to the extent that Event Box is found liable for anything related to this
                Agreement, or the use of the Event Box service(s), Event Box’s liability for damages will not exceed the
                equivalent of any Order that you have duly entered into with a Vendor, and further, to the extent that
                the Order has been executed at Your event.</li>

            <li><span>Indemnification.</span> Planner hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, hold harmless Event Box, its
              directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, attorneys, independent contractors, providers,
              successors and assigns, subsidiaries, parent company(ies) and affiliates from and against any and all
              claim, loss, expense or demand of liability, including attorneys’ fees and costs incurred, in connection
              with: (1) Planner’s use or inability to use the Event Box Platform or to obtain work from a Planner; or
              (2) your violation of any law or rights of any other Vendor, Planner, Event Box, or related third-party;

              or incorrect, or infringes upon the rights, including intellectual property rights of any party other than
              yourself. Event Box reserves the exclusive right, at Planner’s expense, to assume the exclusive defense
              and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
              Planner shall not settle any claim or matter without the express written consent of Event Box, which
              consent may be unreasonably withheld, provided that the settlement includes a complete release for the

            <li><span>Breach of Agreement and Liquidated Damages.</span> You expressly agree and acknowledge that,
              because damages are often difficult to calculate, if it becomes necessary for Event Box to pursue legal
              action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, You will be liable to pay us the following amounts of
              liquidated damages, where applicable, which You accept as reasonable estimates of Event Box’s damages for
              the specified breaches of this Agreement:</li>

                a quote from the Vendor through the Event Box Platform, but engage that Vendor’s services independent of
                the Event Box Platform, you agree to pay Event Box a fee of twenty (20%) percent of the value of your
                agreement with the Vendor.</li>
              <li>If you post Content in violation of this Agreement, You agree to promptly pay Event Box one thousand
                ($1,000) dollars for each item of Content posted in violation of this Agreement. We may (but shall not
                be required to) issue You a warning before assessing damages.</li>
              <li>Except as set forth to the contrary herein, You agree to pay the actual damages suffered by Event Box,
                including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, to the extent such actual
                damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, we reserve
                the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained herein, or a preliminary or
                permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted
                in this Agreement, or any combination thereof.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span>Force Majeure.</span> Other than pending payment obligations, neither Event Box nor Planner shall
              be liable to the other for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement arising out of a cause
              beyond the control of either party, including, but not limited to: floods, fires, earthquakes, strikes,
              unavailability of required utilities, blackouts, acts of God, act of war, acts of regulatory agencies or
              the government, terrorism or terroristic acts, national emergencies, pandemics or natural disasters.</li>
            <li><span>Entire Agreement.</span> This Agreement, including any attachments and related agreements,
              including, without limitation the Membership Agreement and the Privacy Policy, or as otherwise
              incorporated by reference, sets forth the entire agreement between Event Box and Planner, with regard to
              the subject matter hereof. All prior agreements, representations and warranties, express or implied, oral
              or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof, are superseded by this Agreement. If any provision
              of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision
              shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, which shall remain in full
              force and effect.</li>
            <li><span>Assignments; Waiver; Severability.</span> This Agreement may not be assigned by Planner without
              the prior written consent of Event Box, which may be unreasonably withheld in Event Box’s sold discretion
              and any attempt to do so shall be null and void and of no effect. Failure by either party at any time to
              require performance by the other party or to claim a breach of a provision of this Agreement shall not be
              construed as a waiver of any right accruing under this Agreement, nor shall it affect any subsequent
              breach, the effectiveness of this Agreement, or any part hereof, nor shall it prejudice either party
              regarding any subsequent action. No provision may be amended, modified, terminated, or revoked, except by
              a writing signed by all parties hereto. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
              the parties hereto and their respective successors and any permitted assigns. If any provisions of this
              Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining terms and provisions
              shall be unaffected thereby and shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
            <li><span>Construction.</span> Each party represents that they have read this Agreement, and that they have
              had the opportunity to review the same with an attorney of its choice. All counsel shall be held harmless
              in the event that there is any dispute relating to the drafting, construction, or interpretation of this

              with the laws of the State, City and County of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions
              of such State. The Parties hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or
              claim that any action, suit or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Planner agrees that
              regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
              or the Event Box Platform, or any services offered by Event Box or the Event Box Platform must commence
              within six (6) months after the claim or cause of action arises. Otherwise, such claim or cause of action
              is permanently barred, unless not permitted by relevant law.</li>
            <li><span>Arbitration.</span> You hereby agree and consent to engage in Arbitration for any dispute, claim,
              or controversy arising out of or relating to the breach, dispute, termination, enforcement,
              interpretation, or validity of this Agreement and Event Box and Vendor both waive their respective rights
              to a jury trial to participate as a Plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or proceeding.

              (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures, in existence at
              the time of dispute. However, for applicable matters, each party hereby reserves its right to seek relief
              in equity or injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the immediate, urgent,
              threatened or actual infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property
              rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other rights.</li>
